Dataset is extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset.
#reading the feature names for x_train and x_test data that are available in UCI HAR Dataset folder, i name the first column to n and feature colomns to feature_names 
features <- read.table("UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt", col.names = c("n","feature_names"))

# reading the activity text file, i named the first column to code, which is the coded version of the activities in second columns that i called activities.(coding the categorical variable "activity")

# part5:Final_Data is created  Tidy_Data is summerized by taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after being groupped by subject and activity by group_by function and final_Data is created and written by write.table function (the whole process is done by pipeline technique).
